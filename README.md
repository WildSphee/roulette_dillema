I created this very simple roulette script to settle a debate:

in roulette you are expected to lose money no matter what 
the chance for betting and losing money is roughly 1/37
if you're betting straight up number (aka straight up), due to there being 0-36 (37) numbers,
and the return is 36 times your origin (you pay 100 gets 3600). You roughly lose 1/37 percent of every bet

and for red and black bets are the same, 0 doesn't count to either. so you lose 1/37 as well
and for odd even also the same, 0 doesn't count
if you're betting even and odd at the same time of the same size of bet. The chance of you winning is 0, cause you never gain any money

## my theory is this:
## Betting a even number straight up - lets say 12, while betting odd at the same time, you have a larger expected loss than betting 12 and even at the same time

this script proved me wrong. turns out no matter the mixture of bet: even or odd at the same time / 12 or odd / 12 or even. The expected loss is still the same
Its -1/37 percent every single time.
